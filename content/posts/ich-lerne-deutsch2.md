description: "Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions."

## Description

The purpose of the thesis is to create a German language training site. This will be achieved through applications like a translator, dictionary, exercises, and e-book.

First will be created a Home page with general information about the website. Then a Dictionary page where the user will be able to display the dictionary (words translated from German to Greek) according to the category he wishes with a filtered search. Also, a Translator page where the user can translate a word or a text from German to Greek and vice versa. The translator will be implemented using API. The Contact page will also be created where there will be a contact form connected to the database with validation rules. Finally, will be added an e-book with additional applications.

To implement the thesis will be used tools and technologies like HTML, CSS, Sass, JSON, JavaScript, Vue JS, VuePress, Firebase Realtime Database, Yandex API and VS Code, Git, GitHub Pages, and Node.js.
