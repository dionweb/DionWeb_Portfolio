description: "Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions."

# Shell-scripts

Custom scripts collection 

### CleanArch .sh

After upgrading ArchLinux you may now have unwanted .pkg from the system and packages that are no longer needed or that are no longer in the official repositories. I created this script to maintain my system. It cleans pkg cache, home cache and unused/orphan packages. Works only with Arch or Arch based distros.

### Deploy .sh

Script to deploy repository on github.

### DisableTracker .sh

GNOME's tracker is a CPU and privacy hog. This script disables the tracker

### Dotfiles .sh

Dotfiles. sh installs my [.dotfiles](https://github.com/dionweb/Dotfiles). Used to install .dotfiles on other systems.

### PacmanQuiz .sh

Pacman knowledge mini-quiz created for fun.
